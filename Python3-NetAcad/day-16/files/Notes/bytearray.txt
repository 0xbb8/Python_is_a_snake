bytearray - A class in python to handle streams of amorphous data i.e.Eg. bytes of an image
---
amorphous data: Data without any shape or form.
---

The object to handle such data should be explicitly instantiated. Such as using the constructor:

data = bytearray(10)

-> this creates an object that can handle 10 bytes
-> The whole array is filled with zeros (0)
