# A ** (double asterisk) sign is an exponentiation (power) operator.
# Its left argument is the base, its right, the exponent

# The result of integer division is always rounded to the nearest integer value that is less than the real (not rounded) result.
# This is very important: rounding always goes to the lesser integer.

# Integer division can also be called floor division. You will definitely come across this term in the future.

# In subtracting applications, the minus operator expects two arguments: the left (a minuend in arithmetical terms) and right (a subtrahend).

# The binding of the operator determines the order of computations performed by some operators with equal priority, put side by side in one expression.
# Most of Python's operators have left-sided binding, which means that the calculation of the expression is conducted from left to right.
# Exponentiation operator is the only operator with right-sided binding. Calculation starts from right to left.
