# an indented instruction or set of instructions (at least one instruction is absolutely required);
# the indentation may be achieved in two ways - by inserting a particular number of spaces 
# (the recommendation is to use four spaces of indentation), or by using the tab character;
# note: if there is more than one instruction in the indented part, the indentation should be the same in all lines;
# even though it may look the same if you use tabs mixed with spaces, 
# it's important to make all indentations exactly the same - Python 3 does not allow mixing spaces and tabs for indentation.
