# print("Hello, World!")

# function_name(arguements)

When function is invoked in python, this is these are the steps that python takes:

1) First checks the existance of the invoked function in it's data set.
2) Checks the function's listed arguments meet the specifications of the function. 
3) Leaves the code and gets in deep with the function with your provided arguements.
4) Function executes with your arguements and gives a result.
5) Returns back to your code and on to the next line it goes.

## NOTE: It will give an error if any steps given above generate error.

# There cannot be more than one instruction in a line.

The way in which we are passing the arguments into the print() function is the most common in Python,
and is called the positional way 
(this name comes from the fact that the meaning of the argument is dictated by its position,
e.g., the second argument will be outputted after the first, not the other way round).
