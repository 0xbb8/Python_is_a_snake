# The program prompts the user to input some data from the console 
(most likely using a keyboard, although it is also possible to input data using voice or image);

# the input() function is invoked without arguments (this is the simplest way of using the function); 
the function will switch the console to input mode;
you'll see a blinking cursor, and you'll be able to input some keystrokes, finishing off by hitting the Enter key;
all the inputted data will be sent to your program through the function's result;

# note: you need to assign the result to a variable; this is crucial - missing out this step will cause the entered data to be lost;

# then we use the print() function to output the data we get, with some additional remarks.
