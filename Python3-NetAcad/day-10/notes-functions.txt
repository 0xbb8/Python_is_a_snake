Functions are used to optimize code.
Making the code more modular.
This makes programming and debugging easy.
The process of making the code more modular by isolating the duplicate and complex
lines of code is commonly referred to as "Decomposition"

Decomposition is essential part of software development as the code can be divided
and worked on by many programmers all at once.

If you're going to divide the work among multiple programmers,
decompose the problem to allow the product to be implemented 
as a set of separately written functions packed together in different modules.

See this website for python's built in function list:

### Parameterized functions ###
-> parameters exist only inside functions in which they have been defined,
   and the only place where the parameter can be defined is a space between
   a pair of parentheses in the def statement;
-> assigning a value to the parameter is done at the time of the function's
   invocation, by specifying the corresponding argument.

### Notes ###
-> parameters live inside functions (this is their natural environment)
-> arguments exist outside functions, and are carriers of values passed to corresponding parameters.
