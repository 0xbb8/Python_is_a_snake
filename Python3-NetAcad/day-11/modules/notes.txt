A namespace is a space (understood in a non-physical context) in which some names exist
and the names don't conflict with each other (i.e., there are not two different objects of the
same name). We can say that each social group is a namespace - the group tends to name 
each of its members in a unique way (e.g., parents won't give their children the same first names).

If the module of a specified name exists and is accessible (a module is in fact a Python source file), 
Python imports its contents, i.e., all the names defined in the module become known, but they don't enter your code's namespace.

This means that you can have your own entities named sin or pi and they won't be affected by the import in any way.
