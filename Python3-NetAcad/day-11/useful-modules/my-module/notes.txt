When Python imports a module for the first time, it translates its
contents into a somewhat compiled shape. The file doesn't contain 
machine code - it's internal Python semi-compiled code, ready to be 
executed by Python's interpreter. As such a file doesn't require lots 
of the checks needed for a pure source file, the execution starts faster, 
and runs faster, too.
